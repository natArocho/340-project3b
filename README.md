FPU for Neural Network

This is a Floating Point Unit that can do addition and multiplication for floating point numbers. The FPUs are meant to be used in a Neural Network that can be found in iris_nn.sv

SystemVerilog written by me can be found in studentlib.sv and fpu.sv

A (rough) block diagram of my FPU can be found in fpuDiagram.pdf

The project report found in project3bReport.pdf is pretty interesting too, it explains some neat optimizations I did on the project FPU and extra credit FPU.

I mainly backed this up to GitHub because my design ended up being suprisingly small in area and critical path delay (I even gained extra credit for being the smallest/fastest design among my undergrad peers!). In other words it is a project I am quite fond of :)
